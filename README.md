# Demographic-Factor-on-Voter-Turnout

Collaborate work using Pyspark, Google Cloud Engine, and Jupyter Notebook for analyzing multiple big datasets of with 700 different variables and up to 6 million entries.

In this report, we analyzed the relationship between voter turnout and income level, house owner-
ship cost, homeownership at the county level, and child presence amongst 4 different states: New

Jersey, Nevada, Washington, and Alaska. The intent of this project was to create a model and
conclusion on how these demographic factors can help candidates in their future elections strive to
improve equity in their electoral process. The analysis of each factor was meticulously explored,
and the conclusions of each were as follows.
At first glance we notice that a significant number of the citizens in the states we researched do not
vote, which leads us to think why there is voter disparity. We found that in all four states there
are more homeowners than renters, and homeowners tend to vote more than renters. This led us
to another question, do people with a higher home price tend to vote more or vice versa? It was
found that people among all home prices vote and there is no significant disparity among voters
who live in different priced houses.


Regarding homeownership in counties in regards to voter turnout, in each state, from the barcharts,
it was clear that counties with the highest homeownership had the highest voter turnout. Reasons
for this correlation can fall into categories of high financial investment, age, and stability. Voters
that own homes may be more likely to be involved in policies regarding property and taxes, may
be older and feel a sense of responsibility towards the community and country.
For income level, extremes where income is very low or very high is the general group of voters that
voted more rather than not voting for all four states. Even more extreme is the group of voters
with the highest income where for 2 of the states 100% of them voted. This could be due to the
fact that the results of the voting matters more to these people than those people in the middle
class. However, it can be seen that generally people across all different income levels tend to vote
more than not. For child presence, we found voting rates with no child presence across the four
states to be slightly higher but not significantly. Itâ€™s hard to make a determination as to whether
child presence is truly the factor that impacts the voting rates or if its other variables that may
affect child presence, such as age. When comparing child presence and voter turnout with being a
homeowner or renter, the trends for homeowner vs renter were very similar so significance was not
concluded.

We chose income level, house ownership cost, homeownership, and child presence because we be-
lieved that these four variables were interconnected in a way that separated voters into distinct

groups of votes and patterns in voting behavior. For example, those with high income tend to vote
a lot more than those in the middle class. Our hypothesis was that homeowners and high income
households would have higher voter turnouts. This hypothesis was supported since the results from

the home ownership plot show that homeowners tend to vote more than renters. A possible correla-
tion is that people with high income tend to own homes and are therefore more likely to vote. This

is further supported by our plots which show that counties with the highest homeownership had
the highest voter turnout. Unfortunately, as we have seen in our plots for child presence, voting
rates for those without children were only slightly higher than those who have children. It was not
significant enough to generalize whether child presence is an important factor that impacts whether
a person votes or not. These results can be used by voting advocates in focusing their resources on
a more diverse demographic for a better voting turnout in comparison to general 2020 elections.
